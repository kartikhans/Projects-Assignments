<h1> <center> COL 106: Assignment 2</center> </h1>
<h2> <center> Due Date : February 17, 2019 </center> </h2> 
<h2> <center> Storing hierarchical structure of a company </center></h2> 
<div align="left"> We want to maintain the list of employees in a company. We will be
concerned with two quantities associated with each employee in the company -- name 
of the employee (you can assume no two employees in the company have the same name), 
and the level of the employee. The level denotes where the person stands in the 
hierarchy. Level 1 denotes the highest post in the company (say the CEO), level 2 
comes below level 1 and so on. There is only 1 person at level 1, but there can be 
several employees at level i &gt; 1. Each level i employee works under a level i-1 employee, 
which is his/her immediate boss. Given an employee A, we can form a sequence of
employees A',A'', A''', ... where A works under A', A' works under A'', and so on. 
We say that each employee in A',A'', A''',... is a boss of A. 

We would like to implement a suitable tree data-structure so that we can implement the 
following operations :  
<ul>
<li> <b> AddEmployee(S,S') </b> : We want to add a new employee whose name is S. 
This employee will work under an existing employee S' (note that this automatically
decides the level of S, it is one more than that of S'). 
</li><li> <b> DeleteEmployee(S,S') </b> : We want to remove an employee whose name is S. 
S' is the name of another employee in the company who is at the same level as S. 
When we remove S, all the persons working under S will now work under S'. 
</li><li> <b> LowestCommonBoss(S,S') </b> : S and S' are names of two persons working 
in the company. This operation prints the name of the employee A who is a boss of 
both S and S', and among all such persons has  the largest level. In other words, 
we want to find the common boss who is  lowest in the hierarchy in  the company. 
</li><li> <b> Print Employees </b> : This operation prints the name of the employees in the
company. It should print the names according to the levels of the employees. So first
it should print the person level 1, then people at level 2, and so on. 
</li></ul>

Write a program which implements such a data-structure.  Credit will be given 
to choice of proper data-structures and efficiency. For example, in the second
operation above, one should not just search the entire tree to look for the name of 
the employee S'. Your program should also catch errors, for example  if in the first 
operation above, there is no employee with name S', then it should say it is an error. 
Use the notions of exceptions in JAVA to implement error checking. <br> <br> 

Input format: first we specify the initial set of employees as follows: <br>
Num_Employees <br>
EmployeeName1 &nbsp; &nbsp; BossName1 <br>
EmployeeName1 &nbsp; &nbsp; BossName1 <br>
.... <br>
<br>
After this the file will contain a sequence of operations specified as follows (call the above
operations 0,1,2,3 in the order they are described above): <br> 
Num_Commands <br> 
Query_type1 Employee1 Employee2 (where Query_Type1 is 0,1,2,3. Note that if Query_type is 3, then no other
arguments are needed). <br>
